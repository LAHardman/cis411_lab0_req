## 1. Overview
The development of a use case for a busines system that can facilitate ording a meal from an on-campus provider and having it delivered to the classroom of the person who placed the order.
![Use Case](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122503446/215306052-6d396df2-aa79-44cd-8ed8-8b6854e1c268.png)
## 2. Requirements

    Business: The business objective that the system needs to satisfy.
        B.1 The system must limit orders based on staff capacity, so that the delivery Service Level Agreement of within 10 minutes of promised delivery is not placed in jeopardy. (Pointy Hair Boss)
        B.2 The system must be able to lengthen promised delivery time or turn off orders dependent on weather conditions, so that the staff are not endangered from deliveries. (Flat Hair Boss)
    User: The actions that a user takes within the system
        U.1 The user must associate their account with payment method (e.g., Falcon Dollars or Credit Card) (Hungry Student 1).
        U.2 The user should be able to choose which food provider they want to get each item from (Tim).
    Functional: The functions should the system perform
        F.1 The system must present an anticipated delivery time prior to allowing the user to confirm the order (Hangry Student 2).
        F.2 The system must display an order confirmation once the order has been properly gone through (Papa John Pizza).
    Non-Functional: The characteristics that the system should have.
        N.1 The system must render pages in less than 10 seconds after any user action or application event. (UX Expert Lady)
    System: Specifications about how the system should be built.
        S.1 The system must use Messiah University Single Sign On (SSO) solution for any accounts with a messiah.edu domain. (Policy IT01.02)


## 3. Assumptions
We are assuming the following in regards to the system:
1. The school is capable of holding students accountable for the amount of money they spend on their orders
2. Orders will only be placed to classrooms
3. Students will be accountable for picking up their orders from the designated location
